# Uninformed Search Algorithm Implementation and Visualization

## üîç Project Overview

This project implements and visualizes three fundamental **uninformed search algorithms**:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

Alongside the algorithm implementations and animated visualization, the project measures their **time and space complexities** on various graphs.

## üß† Features

- Implementation of **DFS, BFS, UCS** from scratch
- **Animated visualizations** of traversal paths using `matplotlib` and `networkx`
- Real-time tracking of visited nodes and current position
- **Time and memory usage** tracking with `psutil`
- Modular and extensible codebase (easy to plug in new graphs or algorithms)
